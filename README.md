## Getting Started

Some of the AeroQuote documentation is split into two distinct flavors.  One for Charter Operators (operate a fleet directly) and one for Brokers (Organize charter flights via Charter Operators).

{% hint style="info" %}
Check out the [different types of packages here](https://www.aeroquote.com/pricing/) if you haven't yet got your free AeroQuote trial.
{% endhint %}

Most features are common to both types of Subscriptions but for specific support material, you will see the words (Operator) or (Broker) in the title of the training to indicate which audience it is intended for.
