### Requests

AeroQuote's Requests feature is the easy and efficient way to start creating fast, accurate air charter quotes for your entire fleet. Requests are where you record your customers' charter requests, but that's only the start.  With just a few clicks, you can enter your customer's travel details and see automated charter price estimates.  Your estimates even automatically include ferry costs to provide more accurate pricing estimates. If you are a Broker, your Request module shows you estimated costs and you can send request-for-quotes in bulk with the click of a button.

With AeroQuote's Requests feature, you can take the guesswork out of pricing and get charter estimates that are just right for your customers.



### &#x20; Quotes

Quotes are the central piece of the AeroQuote system and are where you will spend most of your time. You can generate a quote manually, or automatically from a [Request](concepts.md#requests).

#### Options

Each Quote you generate will have one or more Options.  These are sections in your quote where you can provide your customers with prices for different types of aircraft, all in the same quote.  Options are very flexible, you can even create Options without any flights for times when you want to provide things like accommodation or transport packages for your clients.

#### Online Quote view

With this feature, you can provide an online version of your quote, giving customers access to all the details, photos, maps, and notes they need to make informed decisions. Customers can browse the options you have provided and make selections on their preferred aircraft. AeroQuote event provides an online and offline question-and-answer chat feature. When the customer has decided on their proffered option, they can agree to your terms and conditions and accept your quote, all online.
