## Staff as Crew Members

Staff members can be assigned to bookings as crew. When you add crew to a flight in a booking, you'll select from your Staff list.

### Crew Assignment

See [Booking Management](../bookings-operators/README.md) for details on assigning crew to flights.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Tip:** Add all your pilots, co-pilots, and cabin crew as Staff members so they're available for crew assignment on bookings.
{% endhint %}

## Staff vs. User Accounts

There's a difference between **Staff** (listed here) and **Users** (people who can log in):

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Staff** | People in your organization (crew, office staff) |
| **Users** | Login accounts with access to AeroQuote |

A staff member can exist without a user account (e.g., a pilot who doesn't need system access). To give a staff member login access, you'll need to create a User account for them through Settings → Permissions.

---

## Deleting Staff

1. Find the staff member in the list
2. Click the **Delete** button (trash icon)
3. Confirm the deletion

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Careful!** Deleting a staff member may affect historical booking records where they were assigned as crew. Consider marking them as inactive instead if they've been assigned to past bookings.
{% endhint %}
