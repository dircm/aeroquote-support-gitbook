## Tips

{% hint style="success" %}
**Start minimal** — Enable only what you need. You can always turn on more modules later as your needs grow.
{% endhint %}

- Fewer active modules = cleaner interface
- Train new staff with limited modules, then expand
- Review your module configuration quarterly
