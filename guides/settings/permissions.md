# 🔐 Permissions

The Permissions page lets you manage user accounts and control what each team member can see and do in AeroQuote.

---

## Accessing Permissions

1. Go to **Settings** from the sidebar
2. Click **Permissions** (or navigate to Settings → Permissions)

---

## User List

The Permissions page shows all users with access to your AeroQuote account:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | User's full name |
| **Email** | Login email address |
| **Role** | Their permission level |
| **Status** | Active or inactive |
| **Last Login** | When they last accessed AeroQuote |

---

## Adding a New User

1. Click **Add User**
2. Enter the user's details:
   - **Name** — Full name
   - **Email** — Their login email (must be unique)
   - **Role** — Select their permission level
3. Click **Save**

The user receives an email invitation to set up their password.

## User Roles

AeroQuote uses role-based permissions:

| Role | Access Level |
|------|--------------|
| **Owner** | Full access to everything including billing |
| **Admin** | Full access except billing and account deletion |
| **Manager** | Create and manage quotes, bookings, and contacts |
| **User** | View and work with assigned items |
| **Read-only** | View only, no editing capabilities |

{% hint style="info" %}
Role names and permissions may vary based on your subscription plan. Contact support for custom role configurations.
{% endhint %}

---

## Editing User Permissions

1. Find the user in the list
2. Click **Edit**
3. Update their role or details
4. Click **Save**

---

## Deactivating a User

When someone leaves your organization:

1. Find their account
2. Click **Deactivate** (or toggle Status to Inactive)
3. Confirm the change

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deactivated users cannot log in but their activity history is preserved. Use this instead of deleting to maintain audit trails.
{% endhint %}

---

## Reactivating a User

To restore access:

1. Find the deactivated user
2. Click **Activate** (or toggle Status to Active)
3. They can log in again with their existing credentials

---

## Best Practices

{% hint style="success" %}
**Principle of least privilege** — Give users only the access they need to do their job.
{% endhint %}

- Review permissions quarterly
- Deactivate users immediately when they leave
- Use Admin role sparingly
- Keep at least two Owner accounts for redundancy
