# ⛽ Fuel Discounts

## Types of Fuel Discounts

AeroQuote supports two types of fuel discounts:

### 1. Brand Discounts

Discounts negotiated with specific fuel brands (e.g., Air BP, Avfuel, Shell).

- Applies at any airport where that brand operates
- Set as a percentage or fixed amount per gallon/liter

### 2. Airport Discounts

Discounts at specific airports, regardless of fuel brand.

- Useful for home-base or frequently used airports
- Overrides brand discounts if both apply

3. If none, checks for a **brand discount** at that airport
4. Applies the best available discount
