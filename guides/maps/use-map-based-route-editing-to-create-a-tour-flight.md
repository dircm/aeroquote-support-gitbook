# Use map-based route editing to create a tour flight

AeroQuote offers a route edit feature where you can change the route between two airports (or to and from the same airport) away from a single straight line.

We will build a tour flight around the famous Sydney Harbour in this demonstration.

The Flight will be in a Robinson R44 based at Sydney International Airport (YSSY).

The tour will depart YSSY and arrive back at the same airport.

Use the interactive video below to learn how to create a Tour flight that departs and arrives from the same airport using map-based route editing.
