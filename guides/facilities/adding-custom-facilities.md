# Adding Custom Facilities

Custom facilities allow you to create specific location records for airports you frequently use, providing detailed information that goes beyond basic airport data.

## When to Create Custom Facilities

Consider creating custom facilities when you:
- Have preferred service providers at specific airports
- Need to specify exact locations within large airports
- Want to maintain consistent facility information across quotes
- Require detailed contact information for operational coordination

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Navigate to Facilities Management

From your AeroQuote dashboard:
1. Go to your operator settings or aircraft management section
2. Look for the "Facilities" or "Add Facility" option
3. Click to start the facility creation wizard

### 2. Select Airport

{% hint style="info" %}
You must select an airport before creating a facility, as all facilities are linked to specific airports.
{% endhint %}

1. Search for your target airport using:
   - Airport name (e.g., "John F Kennedy International")
   - IATA code (e.g., "JFK")
   - ICAO code (e.g., "KJFK")
2. Select the correct airport from the search results

### 3. Choose Facility Type

Select the appropriate facility type:
- **FBO**: For commercial aviation service providers
- **Custom**: For your specific operational needs

### 4. Enter Basic Information

Complete the following required fields:

#### Facility Name
- Use a clear, descriptive name
- Example: "Signature Flight Support JFK Terminal 4"

#### Contact Information
- **Phone Number**: Primary contact number
- **Email Address**: Facility contact email
- **Website**: Facility website URL (optional)

#### Radio Frequency
- Enter the facility's radio frequency for pilot communications
- Format: XXX.XXX (e.g., 121.900)

### 5. Location Details

#### Address Information
1. Enter the facility's street address
2. The system will attempt to validate and geocode the address
3. GPS coordinates will be automatically populated

#### Location Description
Provide additional location details such as:
- Terminal or building numbers
- Specific entrance instructions
- Parking information
- Any special access requirements

### 6. Additional Information

#### Facility Notes
Add any operational notes that would be helpful for:
- Pilots and crew
- Passengers
- Ground handling staff
- Future reference

Examples:
- "24-hour fuel service available"
- "Crew lounge on second floor"
- "Customs clearance available"

### 7. Images and Maps

{% hint style="success" %}
The system will automatically attempt to find relevant images and generate maps for your facility using Google Places data.
{% endhint %}

#### Automatic Image Retrieval
- AeroQuote will search for facility images automatically
- Images are cached for improved performance
- You can upload additional custom images if needed

#### Map Generation
- Interactive maps are generated automatically
- Static map images are cached for PDF generation
- Satellite view and driving directions are included

### 8. Review and Save

1. Review all entered information for accuracy
2. Verify that contact details are correct
3. Check that location information is precise
4. Save the facility

## After Creating a Facility

### Immediate Availability
- Your new facility will be available immediately for use in quotes and bookings
- It will appear in facility selection dropdowns for the associated airport

### Integration with Quotes
- When creating quotes for the associated airport, your custom facility will appear as an option
- Facility information will be included in customer-facing documents
- Contact details will be available for operational coordination

### Visibility to Team Members
- All operators in your account can see and use the facility
- Team members can edit facility information as needed

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
- Use consistent naming patterns across your facilities
- Include the service provider name when applicable
- Specify terminal or area information for large airports

### Contact Information
- Verify phone numbers and email addresses before saving
- Include backup contact information in notes if available
- Update contact details regularly to maintain accuracy

### Location Accuracy
- Double-check GPS coordinates for precision
- Include detailed location descriptions for complex airports
- Add any special access or security requirements

### Operational Notes
- Include information relevant to flight operations
- Note any special services or limitations
- Update notes based on crew feedback and experience

## Troubleshooting

### Address Not Found
If the system cannot geocode your address:
1. Try a more general address (remove suite/unit numbers)
2. Use the airport's main address as a fallback
3. Manually adjust GPS coordinates if needed

### Duplicate Facilities
Before creating a new facility:
1. Check if a similar facility already exists at the airport
2. Consider editing an existing facility instead
3. Use clear naming to differentiate similar facilities

### Missing Information
If you don't have complete information:
1. Save the facility with available details
2. Return later to add missing information
3. Use notes to indicate what information is pending
