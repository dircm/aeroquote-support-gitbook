# Facilities

## What are Facilities?

Facilities in AeroQuote are specific locations or services at airports that you can reference when creating quotes and managing bookings. They provide detailed information beyond basic airport data, helping you offer precise location details to your customers.

## Types of Facilities

### FBO (Fixed Base Operators)
These are commercial aviation service providers imported from external data sources. FBOs typically offer services like:
- Fuel services
- Aircraft handling
- Passenger services
- Hangar space
- Maintenance services

### Custom Facilities
These are facilities you create manually for your specific operational needs, such as:
- Private terminals
- Specific hangars
- Custom service providers
- Specialized facilities unique to your operations

## How Facilities Work

Facilities are connected to airports and can include:

- **Contact Information**: Phone numbers, email addresses, websites
- **Location Details**: GPS coordinates, addresses, detailed descriptions
- **Visual Information**: Photos and interactive maps
- **Radio Frequencies**: Communication frequencies for pilots
- **Service Notes**: Additional operational information
