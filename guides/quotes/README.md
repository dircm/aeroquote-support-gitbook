# Quotes

Quotes are the second step of a [customer flow](../../getting-started/concepts.md#customer-flow).  Quotes are the central piece of the AeroQuote system and are where you will spend most of your effort learning and customizing.

To get started, learn how to quickly create a quote from a [Request](../requests/).  It's the fastest and easiest way.

Below are two guides to get you started, one for Operator subscriptions and another for Brokers.

{% content-ref url="create-a-quote-from-a-request-operators.md" %}
[create-a-quote-from-a-request-operators.md](create-a-quote-from-a-request-operators.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="create-a-quote-from-a-request-brokers.md" %}
[create-a-quote-from-a-request-brokers.md](create-a-quote-from-a-request-brokers.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
