Here is a list of the actions you can take on the Quote Details page:

* **Copy to new Quote** - this button will copy the quote flights and aircraft options into a new quote.  It will not copy contacts.  When you start the copy process a window will ask you to select a start date for your new quote.
* **Save as Template** - Click here to convert this quote to a template that you can use over again for similar jobs.
* **Delete** - permanently deletes this quote.
* **Accept Quote** - Click here to mark this quote as accepted.  If you have an accounting package integration, this process also creates a draft invoice in your accounting package.
* **Mark as Paid** - Click here to mark this quote as paid.  If you have an accounting package integration active, once the invoice is paid in your accounting package, this status will automatically be set to Paid.  You can also manually set the quote to Paid at any time.
