## Booking vs Flight Status

| Level | What it tracks |
|-------|----------------|
| **Booking Status** | Overall booking (Confirmed, In Progress, Completed) |
| **Flight Status** | Individual leg status (Scheduled, Departed, Landed) |

A booking is typically "In Progress" when any flight has departed, and "Completed" when all flights are done.
