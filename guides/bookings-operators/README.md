# 📅 Bookings (Operators)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Bookings are included in Operator Subscriptions only.
{% endhint %}

Bookings represent confirmed flights. Once a customer accepts a quote, convert it to a booking to manage the full flight lifecycle — crew, passengers, cargo, and status updates.

## Accessing Bookings

From the sidebar, click **Bookings** to view your bookings list.

## Booking List

The Bookings page shows all bookings with:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Reference** | Booking ID/reference number |
| **Customer** | Customer name |
| **Route** | Origin → Destination |
| **Date** | Flight date |
| **Aircraft** | Assigned aircraft |
| **Status** | Current booking status |

Use filters to find specific bookings by date range, status, or customer.

## Booking Lifecycle

A typical booking flows through these stages:

1. **Created** — Quote converted to booking
2. **Confirmed** — Details finalized with customer
3. **Crew Assigned** — Flight crew allocated
4. **Passengers Added** — Manifest completed
5. **In Progress** — Flight(s) underway
6. **Completed** — All flights finished

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [**Details**](booking-details.md) | Basic booking information |
| [**Itinerary**](booking-itinerary.md) | Flight legs and timing |
| [**Passengers & Cargo**](passengers-and-cargo.md) | Manifest management |
