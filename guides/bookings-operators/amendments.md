## Adding Notes to Changes

When making significant changes:

1. Make your change
2. Add a note explaining why
3. Save

The note is stored with the amendment record.

{% hint style="info" %}
Good notes help future-you (and your team) understand why changes were made.

## Filtering Amendments

For bookings with many changes:
- Filter by date range
- Filter by change type
- Filter by user
- Search for specific changes

---

## Reverting Changes

Amendments are a history log — they don't directly support "undo." To reverse a change:

1. View the amendment to see old value
2. Manually update the field back
3. This creates a new amendment record

## Amendment Reports

You may be able to:
- Export amendment history
- Include in booking reports
