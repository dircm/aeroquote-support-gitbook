# 👨‍✈️ Crew Assignment

The Crew section lets you assign pilots, co-pilots, and cabin crew to each flight in a booking. Keep track of who's flying what.

---

## Accessing Crew Assignment

1. Go to **Bookings** from the sidebar
2. Click on a booking
3. Navigate to the crew assignment area (often within Itinerary or a dedicated Crew tab)

---

## Prerequisites

Before assigning crew, you need staff members set up:

{% content-ref url="../staff/README.md" %}
[Staff Management](../staff/README.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Staff members marked as crew-eligible will appear in the crew selection.

## Assigning Crew to a Flight

| **Second in Command (SIC)** | Co-pilot / first officer |

## Multi-Leg Assignments

For trips with multiple legs, you can:

- **Same crew throughout** — Assign once, applies to all legs
- **Different crew per leg** — Mix and match for complex trips
- **Crew changes** — Handle crew swaps at intermediate stops

---

## Crew on the Dashboard

Assigned crew appears on:
- The booking details
- The Fleet Timeline (shows crew commitments)
- Calendar view

This helps avoid double-booking crew members.

---

## Crew Notifications

Depending on your settings, assigned crew may receive:
- Email notification of assignment
- Calendar invite for the flight
- Access to view booking details

---

## Viewing Crew Across Bookings

To see a crew member's schedule:
1. Go to **Staff**

Or use the **Fleet Timeline** on the Dashboard to see crew allocations visually.
