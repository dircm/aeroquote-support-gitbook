# ✈️ Aircraft

Aircraft are at the heart of AeroQuote. Each aircraft in your fleet needs to be configured with performance data and pricing to generate accurate quotes.

---

## Accessing Aircraft

From the sidebar, click **Aircraft** to view your fleet list.

---

## Aircraft List

The Aircraft page shows all aircraft in your account:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Registration** | Aircraft tail number |
| **Type** | Aircraft model (e.g., King Air 350, Citation XLS) |
| **Homebase** | Default location for positioning calculations |
| **Status** | Active or inactive |

Click any aircraft to view and edit its details.

---

## Adding an Aircraft

1. Click **Add Aircraft** from the Aircraft list
2. Complete the setup wizard (see sections below)
3. Save the aircraft

---

## Aircraft Configuration Sections

Each aircraft has several configuration tabs:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [**Details**](aircraft-details.md) | Registration, type, homebase, basic info |
| [**Flight Performance**](flight-performance.md) | Speed, range, fuel burn rates |
| [**Costings**](costings.md) | Hourly rates, positioning costs, minimums |
| [**Cost Simulator**](cost-simulator.md) | Test pricing before going live |
| [**Images**](aircraft-images.md) | Photos for quotes and documents |

## Tips

{% hint style="success" %}
**Accuracy matters** — The more accurate your aircraft data, the better your quotes. Take time to enter correct performance figures and costs.
{% endhint %}

- Keep performance data up to date as aircraft are modified
- Review costings regularly as fuel and operating costs change
- Use the Cost Simulator to verify pricing before quoting
