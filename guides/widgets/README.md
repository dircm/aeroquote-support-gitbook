# 🔌 Widgets

Widgets let you embed an AeroQuote enquiry form directly on your website. Visitors can submit quote requests without leaving your site, and the requests flow straight into your AeroQuote inbox.

---

## Accessing Widget Settings

From the sidebar, click **Widgets** to open the widget configuration page.

---

## How Widgets Work

1. You configure a widget in AeroQuote
2. AeroQuote generates an embed code (HTML snippet)
3. You add the code to your website
4. Visitors fill out the form on your site
5. Requests appear in your AeroQuote Requests inbox

---

## Setting Up a Widget

### Step 1: Create a Widget

1. Go to **Widgets** from the sidebar
2. Click **Create Widget** or **Add Widget**

### Step 2: Configure the Widget

Customize the widget settings:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Internal name to identify this widget |
| **Fields** | Choose which fields to show (departure, arrival, date, passengers, etc.) |
| **Required Fields** | Mark which fields are mandatory |
| **Styling** | Colors and appearance to match your website |

### Step 3: Get the Embed Code

Once configured, AeroQuote provides an HTML embed code. Copy this code.

### Step 4: Add to Your Website

Paste the embed code into your website where you want the form to appear. This typically goes in:
- Your "Request a Quote" page
- A sidebar widget
- A contact page

## Widget Styling

Match the widget to your website's look and feel:

- **Primary Color** — Button and accent colors
- **Font** — Match your website's typography
- **Border Radius** — Rounded or square corners
- **Width** — Fixed or responsive sizing

---

## Managing Requests from Widgets

When someone submits a widget form:

1. A new **Request** is created in AeroQuote
2. You'll see it in your Requests inbox
3. The source shows it came from a widget
4. Process it like any other request → create a quote

---

## Multiple Widgets

You can create multiple widgets for different purposes:

| Widget | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **Main Website** | General quote requests |
| **Cargo Page** | Freight-specific fields |
| **VIP Page** | Premium service requests |
| **Partner Site** | Embedded on partner websites |

Each widget can have different fields and styling.

---

## Tips

{% hint style="success" %}
**Keep it simple** — Fewer fields = more submissions. Only ask for what you truly need upfront.
{% endhint %}

- Test the widget on mobile devices
- Place it prominently on your quote request page
- Consider a simplified widget in your sidebar
- Monitor which widgets generate the most leads
