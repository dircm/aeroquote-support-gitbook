# Sending Request For Quotes

Once you have generated a Quote with an External Aircraft the RFQs will be automatically created (see [creating-a-request-for-quote.md](creating-a-request-for-quote.md "mention"))&#x20;

All generated new Quotes will automatically open the Quote Details page.  A window will pop up asking if you would like to send all the RFQs to all the [External Operators](../external-operators/) immediately.

Clicking **Send All Now** will create emails to all the External Operators associated with the External Aircraft you selected in the Quote building process.

If more than one Aircraft are associated with the same External Operator, the RFQs will be bundeled into the smail email to that Operator.

You may also send the RFQs individually from the **Request for Quotes** page.

&#x20; \- Professional emails are automatically sent to external operators

&#x20; \- Multiple requests to the same operator are combined into one email

&#x20; \- Each email includes complete flight details, passenger counts, aircraft specifications, and any included FBO information
