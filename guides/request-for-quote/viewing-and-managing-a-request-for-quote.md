* Copy the page URL for sending via other methods (messages apps etc)



#### Initial Send

* Click the "Send Request for Quote" button to open the sending window
* Add optional External Notes that will be included in the email to provide additional context or special instructions
* Click "Send Request" to dispatch the RFQ to the external operator

#### Question & Answer Communication

When an external operator asks a question:

* Questions appear in the Questions and Answers section
* Click "Add Comment" to respond to a specific question <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt="" data-size="line">
* Your response is sent immediately to the external operator
* All communications are logged for reference
* Mark questions as "Answered" to manually mark as resolved instead of adding a comment.

Communication Flow:

1. External operator asks question → You receive notification
2. You reply → External operator receives your response
3. All exchanges are preserved in the conversation thread
