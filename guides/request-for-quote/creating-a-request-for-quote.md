# Creating a Request For Quote

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you can create a RFQ you will need at least one Aircraft with an External Operator, learn how to create one [creating-an-aircraft-with-external-operator.md](creating-an-aircraft-with-external-operator.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

Step 1: Start by creating a quote as you normally would either by:

* [Creating a New Request](../requests/creating-a-request-operators.md)
* [Building a New Quote](../quotes/create-a-quote-from-a-request-operators.md)

Add your flight details, passenger requirements, and preferences.

When you include an external aircraft (by clicking the include check ) in your list of available aircraft, AeroQuote automatically generates one or more Request for Quotes in the background after you generate Quote.

All your RFQs can be viewed in the **Requests for Quotes** page.

And the status of a RFQ will always be attached to the Option that uses the External Aircraft.
