# Facilities

Add FBO and Custom Facilities to your Quotes and Bookings to enhance your customers experience.  When you add a Facility to your Quote or Booking your customers will view your Airport meeting points or service locations at any airport.

Air crews can view the FBO location and contact details to ensure seamless operations.

## Using Facilities <a href="#using-facilities" id="using-facilities"></a>

When you select an airport from a departure or arrival selection box, and that airport has one or more Facilities, a **Choose Facility** link will appear below the airport box.  Clicking that box will open a facility choice window.
