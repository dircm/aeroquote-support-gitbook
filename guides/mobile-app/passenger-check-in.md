# Passenger Check-In

The mobile app supports two ways to check in passengers and cargo: **manual toggle** and **QR code scanning**.

## Manual Check-In

On the Flight Detail screen, each passenger and cargo item has a check-in toggle:

1. Tap the **circle icon** next to a passenger or cargo item to check them in
2. A green tick appears with the check-in timestamp
3. The manifest badge at the top updates in real time (e.g. "3/5" → "4/5")

To check in everyone at once, tap the **Check In All** button at the top of the manifest section.

{% hint style="info" %}
Check-in is **one-way** — once checked in, a passenger cannot be unchecked from the mobile app. This is by design to prevent accidental changes during boarding.
{% endhint %}

## QR Code Check-In

For faster boarding, use the built-in QR scanner:

1. Tap the **Scan Pass** button on the Dashboard, or the **blue scan button** (FAB) on the Flight Detail screen
2. Point your camera at the passenger's QR code
3. On successful scan, a **green pill** appears with the passenger's name and a haptic confirmation
4. The progress counter at the bottom updates in real time

### Scanner Features

* **Torch** — Tap the flash icon to toggle the camera light for low-light scanning
* **Deduplication** — Scanning the same code twice within 3 seconds is silently ignored
* **Already checked in** — If a passenger is already checked in, the scan is silently skipped
* **Flight-scoped scanning** — When opened from a Flight Detail screen, only passengers on that flight are accepted

### QR Code Format

QR codes for boarding passes are generated by the AeroQuote web application. Each code contains the flight and passenger identifiers needed for check-in.

{% hint style="warning" %}
QR scanning requires camera access. The app will prompt for permission on first use. If denied, you can enable it in your device's Settings.
{% endhint %}

## Offline Check-In

Check-ins work even without an internet connection:

1. Check-ins are saved locally on the device immediately
2. A **sync pending** indicator appears next to the check-in
3. When connectivity returns, pending check-ins automatically sync to the server
4. Once synced, the indicator disappears

This ensures boarding is never blocked by poor connectivity at remote airfields.

{% hint style="success" %}
All check-ins appear in the [Bookings Dashboard](../bookings-operators/bookings-dashboard.md) activity feed in real time, so ops staff can monitor boarding progress from the office.
{% endhint %}
