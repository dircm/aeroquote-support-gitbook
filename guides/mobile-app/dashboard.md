# Dashboard

The Dashboard is the first screen you see after signing in. It provides a quick overview of your operations.

## Next Flight Card

The hero card at the top shows your **next upcoming flight**:

* **Route** — Departure and arrival ICAO codes with city names
* **Countdown** — Time until departure (e.g. "In 3h 24m")
* **Booking Code** — Quick reference to the booking
* **Passenger Count** — Total passengers on the flight

If you have no upcoming bookings, the card displays a "No Upcoming Bookings" message.

## Operational Overview

Two stat cards give you a snapshot:

* **Active Bookings** — Total number of current bookings (tap to jump to Bookings)
* **Fleet Status** — Number of aircraft in your fleet (tap to jump to Aircraft)

## Quick Actions

* **Scan Pass** — Opens the QR code scanner for passenger check-in
* **View Fleet** — Jumps to the Aircraft list

## Help & Getting Started

On your first visit, a **help guide** slides down from the top of the Dashboard with swipe-through pages covering the key features of the app. You can:

* **Swipe** left/right to navigate between help pages (dot indicators show your progress)
* **Dismiss** the guide by tapping the close button — it won't appear again automatically
* **Re-open** the guide anytime by tapping the **help icon** (?) in the top-right of the Dashboard, or from the **Help & Getting Started** card on the Profile screen

## Navigation

Use the bottom tab bar to navigate between the main sections:

* **Dashboard** — This screen
* **Bookings** — All your bookings
* **Aircraft** — Your fleet
* **Profile** — Account info and sign out
